# Vision & Roadmap Template

![Vision & Roadmap](Vision&Roadmap_v1.0.png)

Brought to you by Scrum Facilitators, a Vision & Roadmap template to help you get started with your team vision and manage your longterm strategy.

Use this template for a more structured approach, covering relevant subjects step by step.

The template is available in the following formats:

- a [Mural template](https://app.mural.co/template/e1ec3c61-e87f-4be8-b246-6e7dc80432aa/00bbfb4f-df79-4760-b042-baf3859467dd) you can open and save to your own Mural workspace,
- a [Miro](Vision&Roadmap_v1.0.rtb) template you can upload to your Miro workspace,
- a [pdf](SprintPlanning_v1.0.pdf) for your printing purposes,
- a [png](Vision&Roadmap_v1.0.png) image file.

The template includes a short manual describing how to use it.

The template should be useful for any type of team. You can use it when starting with a new team, to create a common goal and a strategy to achieve it, but also as a tool to manage the goal and strategy as a recurring part of your team work.

The template will guide you in thinking about the most important aspects of strategy, making it easier for you to make choices and prioritise your work.

**Note** *that you can use this template together with our [Sprint Planning template](https://github.com/ScrumFacilitators/sprint-planning-template), to translate your vision & Roadmap into an effective plan for your sprint.*
